===========

Hello, this page describes the PFE-Crawler, a web-crawler being built as a school project.

So far, the crawler only looks at the pages it crawls and looks for new URLs, no content is saved anywhere.

This crawler respects the robots.txt standard (http://www.robotstxt.org/)

If you wish to stop this crawler from crawling your website, simply add these lines to your robots.txt file:

	User-agent: MLBot
	Disallow: *
